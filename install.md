**Aim:
The classic network is only for study how to build common network by torch or tensorrt-python-api simply,that maybe help more people to study more easier.

**Future:
 Add tensorrt-python-api or openvino  or onnx or other infer frame in future.

**Notes:Due to the limit of time and energy , i will  start to construct the networks  with the tensorrt-python after finished all basical networks.

**install enviroment:
1. your PC: it must install nvidia driver,cuda and cudnn first.
2. make python env:
 21. install miniconda or ananconda
 22. conda create -n myenv python=3.9
 23. conda activate  myenv
 24. pip install -r requirements.txt
 25. same more :go to xxx\TensorRT-8.5.1.7\python,and install tensorrt-python version via your python version:
   pip install tensorrt-8.5.1.7-cp39-none-win_amd64.whl
